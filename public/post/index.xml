      <description>I believe that both Socialism and Capitalism each have their strong points. Why can&amp;rsquo;t we have both?
What is wrong with a safety net for those that are not able to succeed in their own right? We can&amp;rsquo;t all be purfect. Are you willing to bet that all of your children and their children will be able to survive on their own? You won&amp;rsquo;t alwarys be there to give them guidance (or bail them out when things go wrong)</description>

      <title>When is a Freeze Dryer not a Dehydrator?</title>

      <description>I have a theory I intend to explore.
These &amp;ldquo;Freeze Dryers&amp;rdquo; ($$$). that people are buying, are really a &amp;ldquo;Class&amp;rdquo; of Dehydrators; a class that does NOT use HEAT to dehydrate.
A good example is: In my younger days, when we use to help Mum with the laundry (in the winter). Back in my generation, we use to use a clothesline, and we use to hang laundry out to dry. In the (very) cold weather, the laundry use to freeze to the clothes line.</description>
