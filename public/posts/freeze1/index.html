			<p>I have a theory I intend to explore.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;Freeze Dryers&rdquo; ($$$). that people are buying, are really a &ldquo;Class&rdquo; of Dehydrators; a class that does NOT use HEAT to dehydrate.</p>
<p>A good example is: In my younger days, when we use to help Mum with the laundry (in the winter). Back in my generation, we use to use a clothesline, and we use to hang laundry out to dry. In the (very) cold weather, the laundry use to freeze to the clothes line. We sometimes needed to pry the clothes off the line because they were frozen to the clothes line. They were dry, but they were as ridged as cardboard.</p>
<p>As an Engineer, I know a lot about what was happening.
/
The term that apply&rsquo;s is called &ldquo;Relative Humidity&rdquo;. We know that the atmosphere can contain moisture. At each temperture the amount of moisture is different. If the amount of moisture in the air rises, we feel that is is &ldquo;Humid&rdquo;. When air contains too much air (close to 90-100%), it rains!</p>
<p>Below freezing, it can&rsquo;t rain; instead, the water (moisture) changes &ldquo;phase&rdquo; from Solid to Gas (&ldquo;Steam&rdquo;) without first changing to Liquid. Freeze &ldquo;Dehydrating&rdquo; occures quite fast. The speed will be determined by the moisture content &ldquo;relative&rdquo; to outside temperature. If something is &ldquo;wet&rdquo; (100% moisture) and &ldquo;humidity&rdquo; is low (15% of what it could be), moisture content will drop drastically and quickly.</p>
<p>A good example of how fast humidity can change is trying to run an air conditioner with the window open. Humidity is really &ldquo;vapor pressure&rdquo;. The &ldquo;relative&rdquo; vapor pressures (between inside and outside the window) reach equilibrium almost instantaneously!</p>
<p>It theory you could put your Dehydrator OUTDOORS and put frozen vegitables into it and run the dehydrator fan (without Heat), and vegitables should dehydrate.</p>
<p>Be careful about the Racoons. LOL!</p>
<p>This process may even work for meats, however we all know about &ldquo;Freezer Burn&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I conduct this experiment and use store bought frozen vegitables, all should be ok. However, If I freeze my own vegitables, I will &ldquo;blanch&rdquo; them before putting them into the Freezer (summer), or Dehydrator (winter), otherwise the results will not be positive!</p>
