I am starting work on a new RPG game that I have to develop and distribute on Steam.

It will be a "No Adult Left Behind" game that will embrace the concept of applying the principles of socialism with the belief that "Everybody Wins" and "Too Small to Fail."

It will give everyone income (currency) in the form of wages that will include a GUARANTEED Minimum Wage if you are a liberal (Democrat), or a Basic Minimum Income if you are a conservative (Republican).

It will promote electric vehicles and discourage the use of fossil fuels.

Everyone will use third-party transportation, and personal vehicles will not be allowed. Transportation options could include Uber, Lyft, commuter/subway, commuter bus, regional train, and regional bus.

Air travel will be discouraged.
Currency will be digitalized, and banking will be transformed.
All banks will transact business through the FRB Network (Federal Reserve Banks).
   
Taxes will also be transformed. EVERY transaction will include a federal tax (TBD) of 1% to 10%, a state tax (TBD) of 1% to 16%, a local (city/town) tax of 3%, and a transaction fee of 3% (similar to Bitcoin, but paid to the two banks involved in the transaction).

Living accommodations and lifestyles will be transformed, and healthcare will also be transformed.
