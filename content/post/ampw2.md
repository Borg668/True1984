I believe that both Socialism and Capitalism each have their strong points. Why can't we have both?  


What is wrong with a safety net for those that are not able to succeed in their own right? We can't   
all be perfect. Are you willing to bet that all of your children and their children will be   
able to survive on their own? You won't always be there to give them guidance (or bail them out   
when things go wrong)


Hillary may have been right when she said "It takes a Villiage to raise a child"

Mankind sent astronauts to the Moon! I think we should be able to develop a "Cradle to Grave" mindset!


To start off, we need a Basic Gaurenteed Income for those that need it.

To start the program right, EVERYONE should pay Taxes!
These taxes will be labeled BIT (Basic Income Tax) and GAT (Graduated Income Tax).

GAT should be from $0 to $1,000,000,000 (TBD?) x TBD%
BIT should be added to BGI
