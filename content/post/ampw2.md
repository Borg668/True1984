I believe that both socialism and capitalism each have their strong points. Why can't we have both? What is wrong with a safety net for those that are not able to succeed in their own right? We can't all be perfect.

Are you willing to bet that all of your children and their children will be able to survive on their own? You won't always be there to give them guidance (or bail them out when things go wrong).

Hillary may have been right when she said, "It takes a village to raise a child."

Mankind sent astronauts to the moon! I think we should be able to develop a "cradle-to-grave" mindset!

To start off, we need a basic guaranteed income for those who need it.

To start the program right, EVERYONE should pay taxes! These taxes will be labeled BIT (Basic Income Tax) and GAT (Graduated Income Tax).

GAT should be from $0 to $60,000,000,000 (TBD?) x TBD%.

BIT should be added to BGI.
