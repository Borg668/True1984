today I will add a long term Python project to my todo list:

Create a Python Porject intitled: Python Local PBX

it's goal is to create a standalone PBX for family and friends that will allow people to screen their terminal (python) phone calls to only people I know and want to communicate with outside the triditional phone system.

I will create a hardwired USB connection that will connect with a dedicated, wired telephone (Pulse or tone)

in the python console the username can create an address book that will look like a traditional telephone book.

the telephone book will list alphbetivally bo Company Name or by Person (Last Name) and (both will contain a complete address.)

when ane electronic call "comes in, it will be ignored if it is not listed in users address book

When the application is run for the first time, the user MUST add his primary telephone number for his/her Home and/or Business Name.

features will include the ability to clone the users (real Phone) properties as an added measure of validation.
