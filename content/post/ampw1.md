I am going to study and develop ideas for creating solutions to make life better for everyone, including you! Topics may include encouraging people to collaborate with opponents to reach a common goal without sacrificing individual principles. I may also include specific examples based on current events such as politics, energy, conflicts, health, weather, and the economy. If you see any discrepancies in this conversation, please contact me, and I will try to address your concerns.
