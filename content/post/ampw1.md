I am going to study and develop ideas for creating solutions to make life better for everyone, including you! Topics may include encouraging people to collaborate with opponents to reach a common goal without sacrificing individual principles. I may also include specific examples based on current events such as politics, energy, conflicts, health, weather, and the economy. If you see any discrepancies in this conversation, please contact me, and feel free to include possible solutions along with your concerns, because the point of this blog is to come up with solutions, not just identify problems.
