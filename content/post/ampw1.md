I am going to study and develop ideas for creating solutions for making live better for everyone. This includes you!


Topics might include encouraging  people to colaborate with opponents to reach a common goal without sacrificing individual principles.


I may include specific examples based on current events that may include politics, energy, conflicts, health, weather, and the economy.


If you see a descrepancy in this conversation, contact me and i will try to include your concerns. Please try to include possible solutions with your concerns, because the point if this blog is to come up with solutions, not come up with proplems
